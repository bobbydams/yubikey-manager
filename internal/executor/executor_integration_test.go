	// Note: This test is limited because we can't easily simulate
	// GPG's "save" command returning exit code 2 without actually
	// having a GPG key and edit session. The actual fix is tested
	// implicitly through the move-subkey command usage.

	// For now, we'll just verify the executor exists and can be created

	// We can't easily test the exit code 2 handling without mocking,
	// but the logic is straightforward: if name == "gpg" && exitCode == 2, return nil
	// This is tested implicitly through actual usage in move-subkey command.
